> Try this for your next hamstring workout and make them grow!

> I've been using a trap bar because it help takes stress off your low back. If you don't have a trap bar you can use a regular barbell just as well. I recommend a small solid platform high enough to give you a stretch in your hamstrings while keeping you back flat, 5 inches should be enough depending on how you're flexible you are. If you're really flexible you'll need a higher platform. Only use the platform for the first exercise. Make sure you get your hamstrings and low back warmed up before starting. The first exercise is a stiff leg deadlift with your knees slightly unlocked 3 sets 10 - 12 repetitions. Wait about 1 minute between sets. The next exercise is a Romanian deadlift with your knees bent at about 20 to 30 degrees. This improves your leverage so you should be able to add some weight to the bar I'd recommend doing 3 sets of 8 - 10 reps. Take about 2 minutes between sets. The next exercise in the sequence is a full deadlift add some more weight to the bar and do 3 sets of 6-8 repetitions. Take 3 min between sets.
> Immediately go to a leg curl and do 3 sets of 25 reps with 30 second rest between sets.
> Your hamstrings should be fried after that and you might be limping the next day.
> Use this workout for the next 4 weeks for better hamstrings!
> Have a Great Day!
