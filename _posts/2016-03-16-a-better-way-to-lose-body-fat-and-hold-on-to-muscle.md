A better way to lose Body fat and hold on to muscle !

HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training} is the answer! Don't get me wrong low intensity cardio does work and you should mix some into you program. But if your number one goal is to get lean while holding on to muscle, HIIT is you answer. The reason Medium to Low Intensity  training  is not Optimal is that when your body works for a long period of time it need to be lighter to travel long distances. When it gets lighter your body will sacrifice muscle as well as fat. Now resistance training and taking in Complete Protein source will help you maintain muscle, Its not optimal as HIIT for Maintaining and even GROWING Muscle. Sprinting, Stationary bike Sprinting, Pushing a Car( with someone steering and breaking) Prowler sled push or pull, and where from 30 second to 1 minute intervals, and 1 min to 4 min low intensity rest periods. All depending on how conditioned you are.20 to 30 minutes of this will kick your ass.
